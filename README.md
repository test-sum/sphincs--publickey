# sphincs--publickey
Hosting my Sphincs+ public key( but now also hosting the c++ and binaries to sign and validate using Sphincs+) 

Originally my message(and keys) were produced and signed by 128f_simple, but I;ve since changed the default to 256f_simple, producing keys priv:128bytes pubb:64bytes
