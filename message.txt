I have been experimenting with various Post Quantum Digital Signature schemes. 
The first 2 are Falcon, and Sphincs+. Falcon is a Lattice based algorythim, while Sphincs+ uses a hash based system. 

It seems that most of the Post Quantum algoryhims use Lattices, so it makes sense in my mind that Sphincs+(being hash-based) is a good choice for Digital Signatures, effectively load balancing some of that risk. 

In order to use these algorithims I had to write it C++( as the PQC libraries are in C++)

Anyway, I've signed this post with using Sphincs+. The keys produced by  liboqs library are binary. So I've converted these into Bas64( as is general convention with DER > PEM, which I expect will continue to get used)
